- develop a plan and rough roadmap (at least for Q3) for this, and who is responsible for what
- here’s a few things I’d like to see:
  - define different stages of a project (e.g., experiment, dev, QA, release)
  - define what are the requirements for each stage (e.g., maybe experiments don’t need a review process, but dev forward does)
  - identify what would be the highest impact things to codify in a “best practices/guidelines” doc, e.g.,
    - how to do a review and what the review process is
    - branching models
    - what shared infrastructure to use (libraries, services, etc)
    - tests and recommended testing frameworks for node, front end testing framework
    - how to write effective tests (maybe just links to articles here)
    - where code gets checked in (e.g., github vs bugzilla)
    - where issues are filed
    - automaton (build, tests, linters, etc)
