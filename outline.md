- develop a plan and rough roadmap (at least for Q3) for this, and who is responsible for what
  - July
    - Develop detailed outline of deliverable
    - Gather external sources
    - Assign responsibilities
    - Break work up into smaller deliverables
  - August
    - Shane out for most of August
  - September

- define different stages of a project (e.g., experiment, dev, QA, release) and
  the requirements for each stage (e.g., maybe experiments don’t need a review process, but dev forward does)
  - experiment/proof of concept
  - target production
    - gather requirements/designs
    - development
    - QA
    - release
    - iteration through the first 3
- identify what would be the highest impact things to codify in a “best practices/guidelines” doc, e.g.,
  - get to know your teammates, what their strengths are, what they like to do,
    and what they'd rather avoid.
    - talk about how you want to work together before tensions arise. (design
      an aliance in TRIBE terms)
  - where issues are filed
    - GitHub
      - which projects?
    - Bugzilla
      - which projects?

    - cadence of scrubs
    - assigning priority
  - meetings/standups?
    - cadence
    - who takes part?
